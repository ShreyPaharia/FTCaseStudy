    "The following function calculates the average block time for a specified number of recent blocks.\n",
    "It handles potential RPC exceptions and accounts for skipped blocks in the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If no start slot is provided, it fetches the latest blockhash to get the most recent block height.\n",
    "2. It then iterates backwards from this slot, fetching block times for each slot.\n",
    "3. If a block is missing or there's an RPC exception:\n",
    "   - It increments a 'failed_attempts' counter\n",
    "   - Moves to the next slot\n",
    "4. It continues until it has collected enough valid block times (num_blocks + 1 + failed_attempts).\n",
    "5. The function then sorts the collected slots and calculates time differences only for consecutive blocks.\n",
    "6. Finally, it computes the average of these time differences to get the average block time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures that:\n",
    "- Skipped blocks don't affect the average calculation\n",
    "- We have enough data points even if some blocks are missing or inaccessible\n",
    "- RPC exceptions are handled gracefully without interrupting the overall process\n",
